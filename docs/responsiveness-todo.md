# Responsiveness & Typography TODO

## Hero Image + Overlay Text
- Test the hero on 320px, 375px, and 414px widths for text overlap or clipping.
- [x] Add responsive hero image sizes (smaller crops or `srcset`) so mobile downloads smaller assets.
- Adjust `--hero-content-offset` per breakpoint to avoid text sitting on busy areas.
- Tune the overlay gradient intensity for legibility across devices.

## Navigation + Layout
- Confirm nav wraps cleanly on small screens without pushing content too far down.
- Validate card padding/margins for narrow widths and tablets.
- Check scroll cue alignment on smaller screens.

## RSVP Form UX
- Verify tap target sizes and input spacing on phones.
- Check form messaging and summary blocks for line wrapping on narrow widths.

## Typography (Kalnia legibility)
- [x] Switch body text to Playfair Display and keep Kalnia for headings.
- If keeping Kalnia for body, test weights 400/500 at 16–18px with slight letter-spacing tweaks.
- Confirm headings and buttons retain hierarchy and readability on mobile.

## Content Pending
- Wedding party bios and photos (Bridesmaids and Groomsmen).
- Registry details and links.

## QA Checklist
- Test iPhone-size, iPad-size, and laptop breakpoints.
- Verify FAQ accordion animation and readability on narrow screens.

## Completed
- Align schedule directions card styling and spacing with the other schedule cards.
- Swap the hero to the portrait couple photo with a landscape crop for larger screens.
